To cover the most of God's own country in 3 days is a close to impossible task. But I'll still try to give you an itinerary that will make you want more and come visit this beautiful place again.

I have split the itinerary into 3 landscapes, day 1 would be in a House boat in the backwaters of Alleppey, day 2 is sightseeing the Kochi city and day 3 would be in mountains of Munnar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Day 1: Houseboat Ride in Alleppey Backwaters

A visit to Alleppey is incomplete without a ride on a houseboat through the serene backwaters of Kerala. On the first day of your trip, you can start by renting a houseboat in Alleppey and spending the entire day cruising along the backwaters. The houseboats in Alleppey are equipped with all modern amenities and offer a comfortable and luxurious stay.

My recommendation is to book throught makemytrip.com (not a sponser) and the company is KERA Houseboats. [Link here](https://www.makemytrip.com/hotels/hotel-details/?hotelId=201610220027452723&_uCurrency=INR&checkin=06092023&checkout=06102023&city=CTXLL&country=IN&filterData=MERGE_PROPERTY_TYPE%7CHouseboat&lat=9.50754&lng=76.35135&locusId=CTXLL&locusType=city&rank=5&regionNearByExp=3&roomStayQualifier=2e1e9e1e0e&searchText=Alleppey%2C%20Kerala%2C%20India&mtkeys=defaultMtkey)

(If you are trying to book from a country where makemytrip is not accessible, use a VPN with the location set somewhere in Asia, here is my free VPN just for this usecase VeePN. It works as a chrome extension and is safe)
<br/>
I'd choose the overnight option, where the stay starts from 14.00 to next day morning 10.00. So you get to relax and got a overnight stay covered for the day.  
As you cruise along the backwaters, you will be able to enjoy the picturesque views of lush green paddy fields, coconut groves, and local villages. You can also savor some authentic Kerala cuisine on the houseboat, prepared by the local chefs. The chef will take you to the local market in one of the islands where you can choose the fresh catch. The cost for the prep is included in the package, but you'll have to pay for the fish as it is not part of the package. The houseboat ride will give you a glimpse into the laid-back lifestyle of the locals and is a perfect way to unwind and relax.

## Day 2: Sightseeing in Kochi

On the second day of your trip, you can head to Kochi, also known as the Queen of the Arabian Sea. Kochi is a melting pot of cultures and has a rich history dating back to the colonial era.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Your first stop can be the Chottanikkara temple, a famous Hindu temple located on the outskirts of Kochi. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Bhagavathy and is believed to have healing powers. The temple architecture is exquisite, and the temple complex is surrounded by lush greenery.

3. You'll then head to the heart of Kochi,the Cochin Jewish Synagogue, which is one of the oldest synagogues in the Commonwealth of Nations. The synagogue was built in 1568, and is a testament to the rich Jewish history of the region. You'll see intricate chandeliers, ornate tiles, and antique furnishings that are a testament to the unique cultural heritage of this part of India.

<br/>
4. Your final stop in Kochi will be to see the iconic Chinese fishing nets that are one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The fishing nets are a unique sight to behold and are a testimony to the rich maritime history of Kochi. You'll get a chance to watch the fishermen in action, and maybe even try your hand at using the nets yourself! You can also explore the nearby streets, which are lined with quaint cafes, art galleries, and boutique stores.
